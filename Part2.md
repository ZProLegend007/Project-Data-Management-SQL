# Part 2 - Developement Notes and Project Evaluation & Retrospective

## Development notes:
This lists changes to the program since the research stage due to unforseen issues or ideas and general fixes.

### Found issues and solutions:
- **Users should not have access to any data except shows**
  - Usually this would be handled by an API middleman as this would all be server hosted. However instead, the user program will call an 'API' program that will perform checks and authentication such as comparing hashes.
    - This turned out to be a major undertaking but worth it
      - The API will communicate through json with the programs
      - Will add encryption
        - AES, SHA256 with PBKDF2HMAC and 10000 iterations along with base64 encoding
      
  - Encrypted database to ensure proper security and protection against unauthorised access attempts.
    - Hypothetically the whole database could be encrypted in to gibberish txt and then decrypted when needed, then re-encrypted after use with whatever changes. This would protect from database reads as well
 
- **Users should not be able to _rent_ basic shows**
  - Fixed
  
- **Users should not be able to rent/add the same show more than once**
  - Fixed
 
- Renting is no longer a thing, users just buy shows they can't access. Also this is "subscription based" but for the purposes of this assignment, the auto-renewal will not be implemented.
- It is also helpful to know that the statistics and finances that are logged are logged day by day, they will be updated unless it is a new day and then they will start a new column, the data should add on, not log only for that day

THE DATABASE LAYOUT HAS CHANGED IN ORDER TO HAVE A MORE OPTIMISED DATABASE WITH BETTER DATA INTEGRITY

  
- **Subscription level should update immediately on account page after being changed**
  - Fixed
  
- **EasyUserFlix is very laggy currently**
  - Will implement more asynchronous tasks and loading symbols
  - Fixed, Originally had over 250 shows for authenticity, now it's around 30. Python doesn't have the performance for that.
 
- **Communication with API may not be secure**
  - Add **fully** encrypted communication between programs and API
    - Should be relatively simple, just modify the main connection method

- **When a user opts out of marketing, their data is still in the database**
  - Ensure marketing data is cleared on opt out
 
- **BECAUSE TEXTUAL IS RETARDED ON SOME TABS, CLICKING THE SAME TAB TRIGGERING A RELOAD WILL CAUSE A CRASH. IM SO DONE. THERE IS NO FIX FOR THIS. WILL BE A FUTURE IMPROVEMENT.**
  - Fun fact, at 3:28AM I found a fix
  - It's fixed.

#### Notes

In order to make this authentic, and to be able to fully use the API and sql commands, I needed to make something proper. So I may have gone a little over the top and this was a bad idea especially considering the time I had to do this, but hopefully it's worth it. 

This project should 100% reflect my abilities and understanding of all the topics so far. Especially security, py programming (its a gui in python for goodness sakes), sql and more.

The API (EFAPI) responds to query's in formatted json.

This is SO INCREDIBLY PAINFUL. THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN FINISHED AGES AGO!!! GITHUB KEEPS CRASHING MY CHROME ON LINUX, IN ORDER TO STOP LONG GPU HANGS I AM SOFTWARE RENDERING AND THE STUPID RECALCULATE STATISTICS BUTTON WANTS TO CRASH THE WHOLE PROGRAM NO MATTER WHAT I DO FOR NO APPARENT REASON SO IM JUST GOING TO FREAKING GET RID OF IT (IT SHOULDNT EVEN BE NEEDED TECHNICALLY AS EVERYTHING _SHOULD_ UPDATE AFTER EVERY DATABASE ALTERING FUNCTION FROM THE API). GRRR.

Why do I do this... adding animations.
Nevermind, too hard and dodgy in textual.
Adding encrypted comminication for auth.

I know I'm not being assessed on the GUI but this project will be perfect. **I'm gunning for 100% on this.**

## Design Changes from Part 1

### Major Architectural Changes

**1. Database Schema Evolution**
- **Original Design**: Separate RENTALS table with rental periods and return dates
- **Current Design**: BUYS table for permanent purchases
- **Reasoning**: Simplified model and easier to implement for this purpose - users buy content permanently rather than temporary rentals

**2. API Security Layer Addition**
- **Original Design**: Direct database access from applications
- **Current Design**: Encrypted API middleman (EFAPI.py)
- **Reasoning**: Enhanced security, centralized data validation, encrypted communication

**3. Enhanced Financial Tracking**
- **Original Design**: Basic revenue tracking
- **Current Design**: Separate tracking for subscription types and purchase revenue
- **Reasoning**: Better business intelligence and financial analysis capabilities

**4. Marketing Opt-in Implementation**
- **Original Design**: Simple opted-in boolean
- **Current Design**: Marketing_Opt_In with automatic favorite genre calculation
- **Reasoning**: Privacy compliance and intelligent data collection

### Field-Level Changes

| Table | Original Field | Current Field | Reason |
|-------|---------------|---------------|---------|
| SHOWS | Cost_To_Rent | Cost_To_Buy | Changed from rental to purchase model |
| CUSTOMERS | Opted_In | Marketing_Opt_In | Clearer field naming |
| CUSTOMERS | Rentals | Buys | Buys now represent owned content |
| STATISTICS | Total_Shows_Rented | Total_Shows_Bought | Reflects purchase model |

### New Tables Added

**ADMIN_CREDENTIALS**
- Added for secure administrative access
- Separate from customer authentication for security isolation

**Enhanced STATISTICS and FINANCIALS**
- Added separate tracking for Basic/Premium subscriptions
- More granular revenue reporting capabilities

## Product Improvements and Limitations

### Current Limitations

**1. Performance Limitations**

**4. Business Logic Gaps**
- No subscription renewal system
- No content recommendation engine
- Limited reporting date range selection

### Proposed Improvements

**1. Performance Enhancements**
```python
# Add database indexing
CREATE INDEX idx_customers_subscription ON CUSTOMERS(Subscription_Level);
CREATE INDEX idx_shows_access_group ON SHOWS(Access_Group);
CREATE INDEX idx_buys_user_date ON BUYS(User_ID, Buy_Date);
```
